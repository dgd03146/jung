# Jung Archive

> A personal brand digital space for archiving emotions, memories, and experiences

## About This Project
[https://www.geojung.com](https://www.geojung.com)

**Jung Archive** is a personal archive platform for recording and sharing everyday thoughts and moments.
Through blog, gallery, location records, and guestbook, it stores sensory experiences in digital space,
creating a unique personal brand through this process.


This project started as "building to learn."
However, it didn't stop at simply acquiring technical skills,
but evolved into a product that delivers value to real users.
In other words, it was implemented as a way where learning becomes the product itself.

This project is not just an experiment to prove technical skills, but started to document my growth and thinking process as a developer in the form of a product.

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. State Management & UX Performance

**Problem**:
Excessive network requests in fast interactions like comments, likes, and guestbook messages degraded UX.
Waiting for server responses after each user action made the UI feel sluggish.

**Solution**:
1. **Optimistic Updates with Rollback** - Applied consistent pattern across 12 mutations
   - Immediate UI update in `onMutate`
   - Rollback to previous state in `onError`
   - Sync with real data in `onSettled`

2. **Set-based Operations** - O(1) performance for instant like status check
   ```typescript
   const likedBySet = new Set(previousData?.liked_by ?? []);
   const isLiked = likedBySet.has(userId);  // O(1) performance
   
   if (isLiked) {
     likedBySet.delete(userId);
   } else {
     likedBySet.add(userId);
   }
   ```

3. **Smart Query Invalidation** - Prevent duplicate refetches with `isMutating` check

**Result**:
Smart Invalidation and optimistic updates improved perceived response time for comment/like clicks to be instant.
As a result, users experience interactions without delay, ensuring UX stability.

**Summary**: Applied optimistic update pattern across all features, significantly reducing network requests and improving UX responsiveness by 3x.

### 2. Bundle Size & Initial Loading

**Problem**:
Initial design system bundle was excessively large, resulting in FCP of 2.7s and Lighthouse score of 69.
Sprinkles utility classes included unused styles, bloating the bundle.

**Solution**:
1. **Sprinkles Cleanup + Tree-shaking**
   - Set `sideEffects: false`
   - Remove unused utility classes
   - Monitor bundle size with size-limit (components 50KB, styles 10KB)

2. **Vanilla Extract Zero Runtime**
   - Extract CSS at build time
   - Eliminate runtime CSS-in-JS overhead
   - Split styles into 73 `.css.ts` files

3. **Static Path Generation + Prefetch**
   - SSG with Next.js generateStaticParams
   - Optimize navigation with Link prefetch

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Prioritize AVIF/WebP formats
   - 7-day cache TTL
   - Responsive optimization with custom deviceSizes

**Result**:
89% bundle size reduction (2.6MB → 29KB), 85% FCP improvement (2.7s → 0.4s), Lighthouse score of 99.
Users can now access content immediately without loading delays.

**Summary**: Zero-runtime CSS and tree-shaking improved initial loading speed by 85%, reducing user bounce rate.

### 3. Scalability & Maintainability

**Problem**:
As 20+ feature modules grew, code dependency complexity increased.
Type-based folder structure made it difficult to find related code.

**Solution**:
Adopted Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture

**FSD Core Principles**:
- **Problem**: Existing folder structure had tangled module dependencies, making maintenance difficult
- **Solution**: Established features → entities → shared directionality with FSD pattern
- **Result**: 20 feature modules can be added/removed independently, tests can be isolated

**Layer Responsibilities**:
- `features/`: Business logic (20 modules)
- `entities/`: Data models and queries
- `shared/`: Reusable utilities
- `views/`: Page-level composition

**Result**:
Adding new features doesn't require modifying existing logic, and related code is cohesive in one folder, improving maintainability.

**Summary**: FSD architecture adoption enabled independent management of 20 modules, minimizing impact scope when changing code.

## Architecture Vision

This project follows the Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) pattern.

**Goals**:
- **Isolation**: UI, logic, and data layers evolve independently
- **Scalability**: Adding new features doesn't require modifying global logic
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested in isolation

FSD is not about folder structure, but about boundaries design.
The key is the direction of dependencies between layers (features → entities → shared),
through which 20 feature modules are managed with consistent structure.

## Key Technical Highlights

### Type Safety (tRPC + Zod)
- E2E type safety (no code generation needed)
- 100% type safety maintained with 8 routers
- Compile-time error detection on API schema changes

### Zero Runtime Styling (Vanilla Extract)
- Extract CSS at build time, eliminate runtime overhead
- 89% bundle reduction (2.6MB → 29KB)
- Split styles into 73 `.css.ts` files

### Optimistic Update Pattern (TanStack Query)
- Consistent Optimistic Update pattern across 12 mutations
- `onMutate` → `onError` (rollback) → `onSettled` (sync)
- 3x improvement in perceived response speed

Ultimately, the purpose of all these technical decisions was to create **predictable architecture and consistent user experience**.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Reason | Trade-off |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| **tRPC + Zod** | E2E type safety | Steeper learning curve than REST |
| **Vanilla Extract** | Zero runtime CSS-in-TS | Limited dynamic styles |
| **TanStack Query** | Server state caching, optimistic updates | Initial setup complexity |
| **FSD** | Layer isolation, scalability | Complex initial folder structure |
| **Biome** | 10-20x faster than ESLint+Prettier | Smaller plugin ecosystem |

## Performance Summary

This project was optimized with the philosophy that "small incremental improvements accumulate to create significant performance gains."

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| FCP | 2.7s | 0.4s | **85%** |
| Bundle Size | 2.6MB | 29KB | **89%** |
| TBT | 150ms | 50ms | **67%** |
| Lighthouse | 69 | 99 | **+30** |


## Learning Reflection

**Technical Learnings**:
- Learned **state-first** thinking through Optimistic Updates design
  - UI is the result of state, not the other way around
- Realized performance optimization is about **eliminating unnecessary work**, not caching
  - `isMutating` check for preventing duplicate refetches is more effective than staleTime
- Experienced how tRPC type safety contributes to both **development speed and stability**
  - Compile-time error detection on API schema changes



**Meta Learnings (Thought Structure)**:
- Understood that FSD is about **boundaries** design, not folder structure
  - The key is the direction of dependencies between layers (features → entities → shared)
- Learned that design systems are **brand language**, not just UI tools
  - Consistent tokens and patterns increase predictability of user experience
- Realized that a structure where "why it was built this way" can be explained is **the core of maintainability**
  - Code should be understandable even after 6 months

**Trade-offs & Next Time**:
- Vanilla Extract's dynamic style limitations → Could be supplemented with CSS Variables
- Initial FSD structure complexity → Team onboarding documentation needed (supplemented with AGENTS.md)
- Insufficient test coverage → Plan to prioritize E2E test expansion

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates the transition from "learning to production."

Rather than simply executing code,
it's a process of transforming technical curiosity
into a scalable, user-centric product
through design thinking.

**Results**:
- Production environment with real users
- 20 feature modules managed with consistent structure
- Average 70% improvement in performance metrics
- 100% type safety maintained
- Instant UX with 12 optimistic mutations

This project continues to evolve.
Valuing learning over perfection and process over results,
we're creating better user experiences within this structure.
